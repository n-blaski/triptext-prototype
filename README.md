Keep your friends and family in the loop while you travel.

### What is this for?
This app syncs with Google Maps to inform selected contacts when you are departing on a trip and when you arrive. It's useful for families with multiple drivers who may need to keep each other in the loop about their locations. It also provides security in knowing that your family members arrived safely (or can provide early warning of trouble if they take too long to arrive).

### Who is this for?
- Families with multiple drivers.
- Families who value safety.

### How to use:
1. Launch the app.
2. Link your contacts.
3. Plan a trip.
    - Choose route with Google Maps.
    - Choose contacts to message.
4. Press "Go!"

Text messages will automatically be sent to the contacts you chose, informing them of your intended destination and an estimated time of arrival.
